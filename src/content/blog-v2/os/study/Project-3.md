# Copy-on-Write Fork

## Overview
- Problem: Inefficient memory copying in fork()
  - Current fork() copies all parent memory immediately
    - Inefficient and time-consuming
    - Can fail due to insufficient memory
- Solution: Copy-on-Write (COW)
  - Share pages between parent and child initially
  - Copy pages only when modified

## COW Fork Architecture
- Initial State:
  - Child page table points to parent's physical pages
  - Parent's PTEs marked read-only to trap write access
  - COW bit set using RSW (Reserved for Software) bits
- Write Access:
  - Page fault triggered on write attempt
  - Kernel allocates new physical page
  - Original page copied to new page
  - PTE updated with write permission
- Reference Counting:
  - Track number of processes sharing each page
  - Free pages only when reference count reaches zero

## Implementation Tasks
- Core Functions to Modify:
  - `uvmcopy()`: Share pages instead of copying
  - `usertrap()`: Handle COW page faults
  - `kfreevm()`: Apply COW logic to kernel operations
  - `fork()` / `wait()` / `exit()`: Implement reference counting
- Key Challenges:
  - Distinguishing COW faults from other page faults
  - Properly managing page reference counters
  - Handling out-of-memory conditions
  - Maintaining compatibility with existing code

## Cow Test Result
- simplest(): Basic COW Memory Allocation and Behavior Verification
- threetest(): Multi-Process COW Stress Testing
- filetest(): System Call Integration with COW (copyout() Compatibility)

```
...
simple: ok
threetest: ok
filetest: ok
...
ALL COW TESTS PASSED
```

# Large Files

## Overview
- Problem: Limited file size in xv6
  - Current limit: 268 blocks (268 KB)
    - 12 direct + 1 single-indirect
  - Insufficient for modern applications
- Solution: Doubly-Indirect Blocks
  - Support up to 12 + 256 + 256*256 blocks (~66 MB)
  - Structure: 11 direct + 1 single-indirect + 1 double-indirect
  - Maintain backward compatibility

## Current Block Addressing Hierarchy


## Block Addressing Hierarchy


## Implementation Tasks
- Constants and Structures:
  - Change FSSIZE from 2000 to 262656
  - Modify NINODE and NFILE
  - Update on-disk structures
  - Modify inode's `addrs` array and inode structures
- Core Functions:
  - `bmap()`: Implement doubly-indirect address translation
  - `itrunc()`: Free all direct and indirect blocks
  - `create()`: Support new file/structure creation

## Largefile Test Result
- Large File Creation and Sequential Writing
- File Size Validation
- Data Integrity Verification

# Symbolic Links

## Overview
- Problem: Rigid file referencing in xv6
  - Only hard links available (inode-based)
  - Cannot link directories or span file systems
  - No support for broken or flexible links
- Solution: Symbolic Links
  - Store target path as data in a file
  - Can point to non-existent files
  - Enable more flexible linking and references
  - Enhanced for system flexibility

## Symbolic Links Architecture
- File Type Extension:
  - Add `T_SYMLINK` file type
- Target path stored in the inode's data blocks
- New system call: `symlink(target, path)`
- System Call Interface:
  - `sys_symlink()`: (Step 1) Create symlink file
- Modified `open()`: (Step 2) Follow symbolic links directly
  - Handle relative/absolute paths, link loops
- Path Resolution:
  - Recursive resolution for nested links
  - Cycle detection to prevent infinite loops
  - Proper error handling for broken links

# Implementation Tasks
- New Components:
  - `T_SYMLINK` file type in `kernel/fs.h`
  - `sys_symlink()` system call implementation
  - `symlink(2)` user-level syscall wrapper
- Modified Functions:
  - `open()`: Implement path resolution logic
  - `create()`: Support symbolic link creation

# Symlink Test Result
- `testsymlink()` - Core Functionality Testing
  - Symbolic Link Creation and Access
  - Relative Path Handling
  - Circular Reference Detection
  - Broken Symbolic Link Testing
  - Chain Link Resolution
- `concur()` - Concurrent Testing

```

Start: test symlinks
test symlinks: OK
Start: test concurrent symlinks
test concurrent symlinks: OK

# Evaluation
- Completeness The xv6 operating system must function correctly according to the specification requirements.
- Wiki & Commit History Grading will be based on the wiki documentation, so the wiki should be written in as much detail as possible.
- Deadline The submission deadline must be strictly observed. After the deadline, you will get 0 points, and scores will be revised.
- DO NOT PLAGIARIZE ANY COPY!!!

# Wiki
- Design Outline your implementation approach for meeting the project requirements.
- Implementation Explain key code modifications and their purpose, focusing on changes from the original xv6.
- Results Show evidence of successful implementation with:
  - Completion Process, Screenshots of working code, Explanation of program flow
- Troubleshooting Describe any problems encountered, solutions applied, and any unresolved issues.
- Additional content may be included if relevant.

# Submission
- Submit your implemented code and wiki through GitHub.
  - Make the submission branch and submit your repository.
  - The name of the repository is 'os\_project03\_[studentID]'.
- The wiki file should be named 'os\_project03\_[class number]\_[student ID].pdf'.
- Submission deadline: June 19, 2025, 23:59
  - Late submissions (submitted after the deadline on June 19, 2025, 23:59) but will only receive 50% of the possible score.
