**(c)** A CF-tree is constructed with branching factor **B = 3** (max children per non-leaf node) and leaf factor **L = 3** (max sub-clusters per leaf node).

Currently, a leaf node LN1 contains exactly 3 sub-clusters. A new data point arrives and cannot be absorbed into any existing sub-cluster, so it creates a new sub-cluster entry in LN1.
